  <h1>Mauris Tincidunt</h1>
  <p>One example of a well used software that I have used is called Visual studio code. 
    I used this multiple times throughout highschool for a computer science course. 
    This particular software stands out to me because It is very easy to use and navigate through their different tools as well as project files. 
    Another reason I enjoy using visual studio is because it has a wide range of different programming languages and it can easily debug or find an error in your code. 
    With so many features, VS remains very fast without lags which is a huge quality of creating a software design. 
    VS also continues to make new updates to improve their design that accommodates programmers all over the world. 
    Visual studio has become very easy to adapt to and it continues to enhance people's understanding of programming. 
    A good software design is important because it is what affects the users ability to understand, modify and use the design to its full potential. 
    We live in a world where technology is rapidly starting to integrate into everyone's lives and it is important for software to adapt to these upcoming changes so that it stays useful. 
    In conclusion, a good software design like VS is important so that it meets current requirements while also making improvements for the future. 

</p> In the requirement gathering stage the main goals are identifying the stakeholders and establishing the needs for the system. 
This process involves interviews, surveys and other techniques to help gather data from peoples requirements. 
The requirement gathering stage is crucial because it's where you align your project with client expectations. 
This stage saves time and money so that you don't make later changes in the development process. 
It is also key to creating functional and non functional requirements. This ensures that the most important features are created first especially when you have a budget. 

As a system, I want regular automated software updates, so that I can remain efficient and up to date. 

As a user, I want the software to be easy to navigate, so that I can easily find tools and files. 

As a user, I want code suggestions, so that I can write better code without errors.

As a user, I want to be able to work with others and allow them into the editor, so that I can work in groups and allow editing. 

As a system, I want multiple programming languages, so that users can have a diverse range of project options. </p>

1. Efficiency and Productivity: Cemal appreciates all the capabilities Visual Studio provides to help her build and debug her apps faster. She can easily handle huge, complicated projects thanks to its straightforward project structure and solution explorer.
2. Integration with Microsoft Technologies: Because she primarily works on.NET projects, Visual Studio's collaboration with ASP.NET and Azure is an ideal choice. She loves the effortless experience it offers when writing, testing, and deploying web projects.
3. Debugging and Code Analysis Tools: Visual Studio's debugging capabilities, such as breakpoints, call stacks, and real-time code analysis, enable her to quickly troubleshoot bugs, ensuring her applications' accuracy and efficiency.
4. Collaboration and Version Control: Cemal frequently works with other developers and uses Visual Studio's built-in Git capability to manage version control, code reviews, and continuous integration.

User Goals:
1. Improve Efficiency: Cemal who is a web developer, is constantly seeking ways to speed up the writing and testing of code. She uses Visual Studio's shortcuts, debugging tools, and live server capability to shorten development times.
2. Keep Up with the Latest Tools: Cemal is interested in remaining up to current on the latest frameworks, libraries, and tools that Visual Studio provides through extensions and updates.
3. Deliver High-Quality Code: Visual Studio's suggestions and performance profiling tools help to ensure her code is optimized, manageable, and efficient, which is critical for the long-term success of the apps she creates.

Challenges:
1. Handling Large Codebases: Cemal occasionally struggles to explore and manage huge projects, but Visual Studio's search and navigation tools help her overcome this.
2. Performance on Older Machines: While Visual Studio is packed with features it can be demanding on resources, resulting in poorer performance on older  computers. 


Daily Routine:
Morning: Cemal begins each day by analyzing her code and testing for issues with Visual Studio's test tools. She then works on new features or repairs, using IntelliSense to speed up the coding process. 
Afternoon: Cemal spends the afternoon collaborating with her team on GitHub, assessing pull requests directly from Visual Studio. She also debugs any difficulties that arise throughout the day. 
Evening: Before completion, Cemal deploys updates to her apps via Visual Studio's Azure DevOps connection, guaranteeing that her clients have access to the most recent features.
